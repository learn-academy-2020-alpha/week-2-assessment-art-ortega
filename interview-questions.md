Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React lifecycle methods:Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The phases are mounting, updating, and unmounting.
- API:set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another. It also contains the terms of this data exchange.
- event.preventDefault():tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should not be taken as it normally would be.
- DOM events: Events that occur as a result of user action or as result of state change of the elements of a DOM tree.
